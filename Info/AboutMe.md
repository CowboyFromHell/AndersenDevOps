I'm 32 and all my life I was interested in computer technologies. Last year I decided to become a network engineer. I've learned a lot since that time and now it's a perfect moment to have a work. 
It seems Andersen course is the best way to begin career in a strong company.
Second reason to be in Andersen is a feedback from teachers.
And the third will be course materials based on a life experience.
